## Targeted reduction of highly abundant transcripts with pseudo-random primers

These are supplemental files related to our manuscript to be published
soon in BioTechniques ([preprint available on bioRxiv](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/027805)).

This repository only contains light files.  In particular FASTQ and BAM files
are available for download at <http://genome.gsc.riken.jp/plessy-20160322/plessy-20160322.tar.gz>,
or from Zenodo [[FASTQ]](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.48112)
[[BAM]](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.48114).

The branch "BioTechniques-2016" contains the supplemental data in its state at
the time of publication, but in the other branches, the files may evolve.

### Scripts and programs used in the data analysis:
